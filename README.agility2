Welcome to Agility2.

To get started with Hobo and Agility2, assuming you are using a git clone, run:

	git submodule init; git submodule update
	./vendor/hobo/scripts/symlink_plugins

That will setup and pull the right commit of the hobo application into vendor/hobo
and then setup symbolic links to the vendor/plugins directory.
